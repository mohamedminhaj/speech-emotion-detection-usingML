## Speech Emotion Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system using machine learning techniques. The system processes audio files, extracts relevant features, and classifies the emotions expressed in speech using a deep learning model.

### **Overview**
This repository contains code for detecting emotions from speech audio samples. The project uses audio signal processing and deep learning (LSTM) to classify emotions such as neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, and surprised.

---

### **Features**
- Audio preprocessing (resampling, normalization, silence removal)
- Extraction of multiple audio features (MFCC, Chroma, Spectral Contrast, Zero-Crossing Rate, RMS Energy)
- Visualization tools for waveform, spectrogram, and MFCCs
- LSTM-based deep learning model for classification
- Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix

---

### **Dataset**
The code is designed for datasets like RAVDESS, but can be adapted for other labeled speech emotion datasets. Audio files should be organized and labeled according to the dataset's conventions.

---

### **Preprocessing & Feature Extraction**
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Down-sampling to 16kHz
  - Quantization (16-bit PCM)
  - Pre-emphasis filtering
  - Framing and windowing
  - Silence removal and normalization
- **Features Extracted:**  
  - MFCCs (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
  - Chroma features
  - Spectral contrast
  - Zero-crossing rate
  - RMS energy

---

### **Model Architecture**
The model uses a Sequential LSTM architecture:
- LSTM layer (128 units)
- Dense layers with ReLU activation and Dropout for regularization
- Output layer with softmax activation for multiclass emotion classification
